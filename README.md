# Substance-Painter-custom-shader
 A custom shader made for Substance Painter for color customization system in the texture production pipeline for clothes and props. This custom shader allows 3d artists to visualize the final result and make changes inside SP. 
 
 This shader is inspired by the GDC talk "The art and technology behind creating characters for Baldur's Gate 3". 
 
 This shader replaces parts of a model’s base color using an RGB ID mask, allowing artists to recolor fabric, leather, metal, and custom regions via exposed color pickers, while preserving a standard PBR metal/rough lighting pipeline.
